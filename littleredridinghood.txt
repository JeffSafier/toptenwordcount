Little Red Riding Hood

Once upon a time there was a sweet little girl who lived in a village near the forest She was so loved by everyone especially her grandmother who made her a red hooded cloak The girl wore it so often that everyone called her Little Red Riding Hood

One day her mother said

Grandmother is sick Take this basket of food and go visit her Stay on the path don't talk to strangers and be careful

Little Red Riding Hood promised took the basket and set off through the woods

Meeting the Wolf

As she walked through the forest a big bad wolf appeared He smiled and asked

Where are you going little girl

Naively she replied

I'm going to see my grandmother She lives in a cottage on the other side of the woods

The wolf being very sly thought to himself

If I'm clever I can eat both the girl and her grandmother

He distracted her by suggesting she pick some flowers for her grandmother While Little Red Riding Hood wandered off the path the wolf raced to Grandma's house

At Grandmother's House

The wolf knocked on the door

Who is it called Grandmother

It's me Little Red Riding Hood said the wolf in a sweet voice

Grandmother thinking it was her granddaughter told him to come in The wolf rushed in swallowed her whole and put on her clothes He got into her bed and waited

The Surprise

Soon Little Red Riding Hood arrived and was surprised by her grandmother's strange appearance

Grandmother what big eyes you have
The better to see you with my dear

Grandmother what big ears you have
The better to hear you with my dear

Grandmother what big teeth you have
The better to eat you with

And with that the wolf jumped out of bed and swallowed her too

The Rescue

Luckily a woodcutter passing by heard strange noises from the cottage He burst in saw the sleeping wolf and realized what had happened He took his axe and carefully cut open the wolf's belly Out popped Grandmother and Little Red Riding Hood safe and sound

They filled the wolf's belly with heavy stones When the wolf woke up and tried to run away the stones made him fall down dead

The Lesson

Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother thanked the kind woodcutter From that day on Little Red Riding Hood remembered never to stray from the path or talk to strangers again

The End
